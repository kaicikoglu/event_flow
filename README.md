# EventFlow

This application provides the opportunity to plan activities or
events with your acquaintances, friends, or anyone else you 
want to organize something with. It allows you to do this better, 
more easily, more clearly, and with more fun.

Every time we want to plan an event, no matter what kind of event it is, 
we create a group chat and invite everyone we want to include. Then the joint planning begins. 
Various polls are created, and files are uploaded. Everyone has great ideas and wants to contribute in some way. 
While this sounds good in theory, it rarely happens in an organized or structured manner. 
It can become annoying and often someone loses their excitement for the planned event.

That's why we have the solution: EventFlow, an app where you can create an event and plan it together. 
The app offers various sections for this purpose:
Resources, Forum, To-Do List, and Vote Area.
